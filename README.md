## Data and Code for MBiol Thesis : Belowground responses to precipitation extremes in a calcareous grassland 

This repository contains all the code and data for the statistical analysis and graphs presented in my thesis. 

The Reproducible_Science_Assignment.rmd file contains the answers to the questions as well as the code and figures. The functions folder contains two additional r scripts which contain functions for plotting graphs (Plotting_Functions.r) and for cleaning the data (Cleaning_Functions.r).

The whole ReproducibleScienceAssignment folder should be downloaded and the working directory set to here in order to run the code.
