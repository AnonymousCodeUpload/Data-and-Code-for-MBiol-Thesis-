## Data and Code for MBiol Thesis : Belowground responses to precipitation extremes in a calcareous grassland 

This repository contains all the code and data for the statistical analysis and graphs presented in my thesis. 

There are three folders relating to each question of my thesis. Each folder contains data and a Quarto file containing code for my analysis.  
1. How do root growth patterns respond to simulated drought and irrigation?
2. How do soil nutrient stores respond to simulated drought and irrigation?
3. How does spatial and temporal variation impact treatment efficacy?

The whole folder for each question should be downloaded and the working directory set to here in order to run the code.
